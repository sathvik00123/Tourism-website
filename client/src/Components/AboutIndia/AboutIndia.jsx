          Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that
          originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse
          India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the
          Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to
          countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India
          by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia
          and Southeast Asia. I ndia's languages, religions, dance, music,
          architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the
          country.Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several
          cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia
          old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early
          cultural areas. Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian
          religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music
          and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater
          India, and the world according to Jean Przyluski. there is evidence
          for regional influence from Austroasiatic groups on certain cultural
          and political elements of Ancient India, which may have arrived
          together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast
          Asia.

          Forestry in India is a significant rural industry and a major
          environmental resource. India is one of the ten most forest-rich
          countries of the world. Together, India and 9 other countries account
          for 67 percent of the total forest area of the world. India's forest
          cover grew at 0.20% annually over 1990-2000, and has grown at the rate
          of 0.7% per year over 2000–2010, after decades where forest
          degradation was a matter of serious concern. As of 2010, the Food and
          Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates India's
          forest cover to be about 68 million hectares, or 22% of the country's
          area The 2013 Forest Survey of India states its forest cover increased
          to 69.8 million hectares by 2012, per satellite measurements; this
          represents an increase of 5,871 square kilometers of forest cover in 2
          years. However, the gains were primarily in northern, central and
          southern Indian states, while northeastern states witnessed a net loss
          in forest cover over 2010 to 2012. In 2018, the total forest and tree
          cover in India increased to 24.39% or 8,02,088 km2. It increased
          further to 24.56 percent or 807,276 square kilometres in 2019.

          India is home to a large variety of wildlife. It is a biodiversity
          hotspot with various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the
          north to the evergreen rainforests in the south, the sands of the west
          to the marshy mangroves of the east. India lies within the Indomalayan
          realm and is home to about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of
          bird, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.2% of flowering plant species. India's
          forests contain about 500 species of mammals and more than 1300 bird
          species. India is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world and
          includes three of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots – the Western
          Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot.It is one of
          the 17 megadiverse countries. The country has 12 biosphere reserves
          and 75 Ramsar sites. In response to a decrease in the numbers of wild
          animals, human encroachment and poaching activities, the Government of
          India established a system of national parks and protected areas in
          1935, which subsequently expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife
          Protection Act of 1972 and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat.
          Further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. India has
          about 2,714 endemic lichen species. In 2020, the Lichen Park in India
          was developed by the Uttarakhand Forest Department in Munsiyari.
